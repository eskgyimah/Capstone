## 🔬 Methodology

### Quality Assessment Framework
Five-dimensional 100-point scoring system:

| Dimension | Weight | Focus Areas |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Methodological Rigor** | 30% | Study design, sample size, statistical analysis, bias control |
| **Reproducibility** | 20% | Methods detail, data availability, protocol transparency |
| **Scientific Contribution** | 25% | Novelty, clinical relevance, knowledge advancement |
| **Reporting Quality** | 15% | PRISMA and STROBE standards adherence |
| **Journal Standing** | 10% | Reputation and editorial standards |

## 💡 Principal Findings

### 1. **Sustained Quality Under Pressure**
Mean quality score of 97.52 maintained across 281 journals and 5 years, challenging concerns about compromised standards during rapid publication.

### 2. **Distinct Temporal Patterns**
- 2020 peak (36% of all publications) coinciding with acute crisis
- Progressive decline through 2024 (6%)
- Quality improved inversely: 97.02 → 98.79

### 3. **Remarkable Disciplinary Diversity**
281 unique journals spanning medicine, social sciences, economics, and psychology, though creating knowledge synthesis challenges.

### 4. **Evolution of Scholarly Communication**
- Substantial preprint adoption (9.1%)
- Robust open-access performance
- Pandemic-driven shifts in dissemination practices
